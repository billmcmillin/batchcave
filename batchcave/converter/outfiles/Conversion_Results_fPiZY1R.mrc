More recently, considerable attention has been paid to the way in which such taxes may also be used to attain public health objectives by reducing the consumption of products with adverse health and social impacts. Some have gone further and argued that explicitly earmarking excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco to finance public health expenditures-marrying sin and virtue as it were-will make increasing such taxes more politically acceptable and provide the funding needed to increase such expenditures, especially for the poor. The basic idea-tax "bads" and do "good" with the proceeds-is simple and appealing. But designing and implementing good "sin" taxes is a surprisingly complex task. Earmarking revenues from such taxes for health expenditures may also sound good and be a useful selling point for new taxes. However, such earmarking raises difficult issues with respect to budgetary rigidity and political accountability. This note explores these and other issues that lurk beneath the surface of the attractive concept of using increased sin excises on alcohol and tobacco to finance "virtuous" social spending on public health. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aHealth monitoring & evaluation 4aTaxation & subsidies 4aEconomic theory & research 4aDebt markets 4aRegressive taxes 4aTax law 4aRisks 4aEvasion 4aProduct taxes 4aAccounting 4aPeople 4aAdded tax 4aPublic economics 4aPublic revenues 4aTax burdens 4aPsychology 4aLaws 4aSin' taxes 4aTax changes 4aSocial research 4aExchange 4aSpending 4aLocal governments 4aTax incidence 4aLocal finance 4aServices 4aHealth care 4aTax evasion 4aSales taxes 4aHealth 4aMacroeconomic conditions 4aTax structures 4aTax 4aExcise tax 4aCrime 4aTax receipts 4aSmokers 4aTax reduction 4aInflation 4aInternational bank 4aRevenue sources 4aSin tax 4aEconomic analysis 4aPublic health 4aUniform taxes 4aKnowledge 4aPassive smoking 4aSocial policy 4aTax system 4aTax administration 4aExercises 4aSmoking 4aIntervention 4aPublic funds 4aSin' tax 4aExternalities 4aValue added tax 4aHealth outcomes 4aMarketing 4aUse taxes 4aTax base 4aTax reform 4aLabor 4aPer 4aEconomic efficiency 4aFinance 4aHealth promotion 4aPublic 4aTaxes 4aTax competition 4aHealth spending 4aExpenditure 4aEarmarked tax 4aAlcohol taxes 4aEquity 4aAlcohol taxation 4aGood 4aTax rate 4aAged 4aTransparency 4aTax revenue 4aHealth policy 4aTax increases 4aHealth effects 4aPublic expenditures 4aStress 4aAlternative minimum tax 4aNutrition 4aMarket 4aDifferential taxation 4aRegulation 4aSocial welfare 4aLevy 4aManagement 4aTaxation 4aWeight 4aEconomic development 4aGoods 4aEffective tax rates 4aChildren 4aIndirect taxation 4aIsolation 4aAddiction 4aTax policy 4aRevenue 4aFamilies 4aGambling 4aGovernments 4aAlcohol consumption 4aImplementation 4aTobacco tax 4aAlcoholism1 aBird, Richard M.18aPrint Version:iBird, Richard M.tTobacco and Alcohol Excise Taxes for Improving Public Health and Revenue Outcomes: Marrying Sin and Virtue?dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750002341cam a22004094a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000022001642450144001862600047003303000030003775200856004076500022012636500031012856500039013166500037013556500024013926500021014166500020014376500017014576500025014746500021014996500025015206500020015457000022015657000019015877000020016067760177016268300036018038300026018398560066018657501The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7501  a(The World Bank)75011 aMatytsin, Mikhail10aFrom Demographic Dividend to Demographic Burden?h[electronic resource]bRegional Trends of Population Aging in Russia.cMatytsin, Mikhail.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (23 p.)3 aDo regions with higher working age populations grow faster? This paper examines this question using data from Russian regions and finds evidence that demographic trends influence regional growth convergence. In other words, keeping other factors constant, poorer regions grow faster than richer regions, and some of the growth convergence is explained by demographic changes: faster growth in poor regions in the past was related in part to more favorable demographic trends. This finding has important consequences for Russia. If the demographic trends in poorer regions worsen in the future, this could dampen economic convergence. Unless there are significant increases in labor productivity or additions to the labor force through migration, growth in Russian regions will moderate as the Russian population shrinks and ages in the coming decades. 4aPoverty reduction 4aPrivate sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aPopulation policies 4aEmerging markets 4aPro-poor growth 4aDemographics 4aDemographic dividend 4aPopulation aging 4aRegional convergence 4aRussian regions1 aMatytsin, Mikhail1 aMoorty, Lalita1 aRichter, Kaspar18aPrint Version:iMatytsin, MikhailtFrom Demographic Dividend to Demographic Burden?

This paper uses the lens of the terms-of-trade theory to investigate three areas in which it is frequently alleged that currently applied tariffs remain "too high"; the implication being that the WTO's job performance to date is incomplete. This includes applied tariffs for countries that are not members of the WTO, applied MFN tariffs for WTO members that are unbound, and applied MFN tariffs for WTO members set in the presence of large amounts of tariff binding overhang. These are almost exclusively the domain of developing countries' own trade policies and they are collectively important; 3.5 billion people currently live in countries in which the WTO has had minimal effect for one of these three reasons. This paper builds upon recent developments in the empirical literature to present evidence-some direct, some indirect-that sheds light on each area. It then identifies specific needs for additional research to clarify policy implications for the future role of the WTO in the ever-changing international trading system. 4aInternational economics & trade 4aLaw and development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aTrade law 4aWorld trade organization 4aTrade & services 4aEconomic theory & research 4aFree trade 4aWTO 4aTariff liberalization 4aMFN 4aDeveloping countries 4aTariff bindings 4aBinding overhang 4aNon-members1 aBown, Chad P.18aPrint Version:iBown, Chad P.tWhat's Left for the WTO?dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750202484cam a22004334a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000022001642450135001862600047003213000030003685200972003986500045013706500031014156500011014466500025014576500015014826500022014976500020015196500017015396500010015566500031015666500021015976500022016187000022016407000022016627000020016847000028017047000021017327760169017538300036019228300026019588560066019847503The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7503  a(The World Bank)75031 aCampos, Francisco10aBreaking the Metal Ceilingh[electronic resource]bFemale Entrepreneurs Who Succeed in Male-Dominated Sectors.cCampos, Francisco.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (39 p.)3 aA range of reasons is cited to explain gender differences in business performance in Africa. Within those, the sector of operations is consistently identified as a major issue. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to assess how women entrepreneurs in Uganda start (and strive) operating firms in male-dominated sectors, and what hinders other women from doing so. The study finds that women who cross over into male-dominated sectors make as much as men, and three times more than women who stay in female-dominated sectors. The paper examines a set of factors to explain the differences in sector choices, and finds that there is a problem of information about opportunities in male-dominated industries. The analysis also concludes that psychosocial factors, particularly the influence of male role models and exposure to the sector from family and friends, are critical in helping women circumvent or overcome the norms that undergird occupational segregation. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aPrivate sector development 4aGender 4aGender & development 4aE-business 4aAccess to finance 4aGender & health 4aGender & law 4aNorms 4aLabor market participation 4aEntrepreneurship 4aSmall enterprises1 aCampos, Francisco1 aGoldstein, Markus1 aMcGorman, Laura1 aBoudet, Ana Maria Munoz1 aPimhidzai, Obert18aPrint Version:iCampos, FranciscotBreaking the Metal Ceiling: Female Entrepreneurs Who Succeed in Male-Dominated Sectors.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750303112cam a22004334a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000017001642450124001812600047003053000030003525201531003826500045019136500031019586500039019896500033020286500015020616500018020766500031020946500019021256500047021446500022021916500041022136500033022546500025022877000017023127000020023297000020023497000023023697760158023928300036025508300026025868560066026127504The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7504  a(The World Bank)75041 aAhmed, Sabin10aStructural Transformation and Productivity Growth in Africah[electronic resource]bUganda in the 2000s.cAhmed, Sabin.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (62 p.)3 aUganda's economy underwent significant structural change in the 2000s whereby the share of non-tradable services in aggregate employment rose by about 7 percentage points at the expense of the production of tradable goods. The process also involved a 12-percentage-point shift in employment away from small and medium enterprises and larger firms in manufacturing and commercial agriculture mainly to microenterprises in retail trade. In addition, the sectoral reallocation of labor on these two dimensions coincided with significant growth in aggregate labor productivity. However, in and of itself, the same reallocation could only have held back, rather than aid, the observed productivity gains. This was because labor was more productive throughout the period in the tradable goods sector than in the non-tradable sector. Moreover, the effect on aggregate labor productivity of the reallocation of employment between the two sectors could only have been reinforced by the impacts on the same of the rise in the employment share of microenterprises. The effect was also strengthened by a parallel employment shift across the age distribution of enterprises that raised sharply the employment share of established firms at the expense of younger ones and startups. Not only was labor consistently less productive in microenterprises than in small and medium enterprises and larger enterprises across all industries throughout the period, it was also typically less productive in more established firms than in younger ones. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aPrivate sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aSocial protections and labor 4aE-business 4aLabor markets 4aEconomic theory & research 4aLabor policies 4aEconomic growth and aggregate productivity 4aIndustrialization 4aManufacturing and service industries 4aEconomy wide country studies 4aEconomic development1 aAhmed, Sabin1 aMengistae, Taye1 aYoshino, Yutaka1 aZeufack, Albert G.18aPrint Version:iAhmed, SabintStructural Transformation and Productivity Growth in Africa: Uganda in the 2000s.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750402054cam a22003854a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000021001642450124001852600047003093000030003565200691003866500013010776500016010906500039011066500022011456500018011676500029011856500039012146500028012536500017012816500018012987000021013167000022013377000022013597760159013818300036015408300026015768560066016027505The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7505  a(The World Bank)75051 aBeegle, Kathleen10aDirect and Indirect Effects of Malawi's Public Works Program on Food Securityh[electronic resource]cBeegle, Kathleen.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (58 p.)3 aLabor-intensive public works programs are important social protection tools in low-income settings, intended to supplement income of poor households and improve public infrastructure.

These disappointing results hold even under modifications to the design of the program to offer work during the lean rather than harvest season or increase the frequency of payments. 4aIndustry 4aAgriculture 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aPoverty reduction 4aFood security 4aFood & beverage industry 4aSmall area estimation poverty maps 4aRural poverty reduction 4aPublic works 4aFood security1 aBeegle, Kathleen1 aGalasso, Emanuela1 aGoldberg, Jessica18aPrint Version:iBeegle, KathleentDirect and Indirect Effects of Malawi's Public Works Program on Food Security.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750502192cam a22003734a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000017001642450108001812600047002893000030003365200873003666500045012396500029012846500052013136500022013656500017013876500027014046500023014316500016014546500021014707000017014917000018015087000021015267760143015478300036016908300026017268560066017527506The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7506  a(The World Bank)75061 aArriz, Irani10aPsychometrics as a Tool to Improve Screening and Access to Credith[electronic resource]cArriz, Irani.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (38 p.)3 aThis paper studies the use of psychometric tests, which were designed by the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab as a tool to screen out high credit risk and potentially increase access to credit for small business owners in Peru. The analysis uses administrative data covering the period from June 2011 to April 2014 to compare debt accrual and repayment behavior patterns across entrepreneurs who were offered a loan based on the traditional credit-scoring method versus the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab tool. The paper finds that the psychometric test can lower the risk of the loan portfolio when used as a secondary screening mechanism for already banked entrepreneurs-that is, those with a credit history. For unbanked entrepreneurs-those without a credit history-using the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab tool can increase access to credit without increasing portfolio risk. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aBanks and banking reform 4aBankruptcy and resolution of financial distress 4aAccess to finance 4aDebt markets 4aAsymmetric information 4aPsychometric tests 4aCredit risk 4aAccess to credit1 aArriz, Irani1 aBruhn, Miriam1 aStucchi, Rodolfo18aPrint Version:iArriz, IranitPsychometrics as a Tool to Improve Screening and Access to Credit.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750603001cam a22004214a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000022001642450173001862600047003593000030004065201436004366500022018726500031018946500039019256500039019646500015020036500020020186500031020386500021020696500015020906500018021056500019021236500026021426500019021686500011021877000022021987000024022207760207022448300036024518300026024878560066025137507The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7507  a(The World Bank)75071 aBrueckner, Markus14aThe Effects of Volatility, Fiscal Policy Cyclicality and Financial Development on Growthh[electronic resource]bEvidence for the Eastern Caribbean.cBrueckner, Markus.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (30 p.)3 aThis paper presents estimates of the effects that terms of trade volatility has on growth of real gross domestic product per capita. Based on five-year non-overlapping panel data comprising 175 countries during 1980-2010, the paper finds that: (i) in model specifications that do not include country fixed effects, terms of trade volatility has a significant negative average effect on economic growth; (ii) once country fixed effects are included in the model, the average effect of terms of trade volatility on economic growth is not significantly different from zero; (iii) robust to the inclusion of country fixed effects, terms of trade volatility has significantly adverse effects on economic growth in countries with pro-cyclical fiscal policy; and (iv) in model specifications that do not include country fixed effects, financial development is a significant mediating factor with regard to the effect that terms of trade volatility has on economic growth, however, the significance of this effect vanishes once country fixed effects are included in the model. The paper also explores these relationships for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States region. A key conclusion from the research is that countercyclical fiscal policy and deeper financial markets will have particularly high payoffs in reducing the adverse growth effects of terms of trade volatility in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States region. 4aPoverty reduction 4aPrivate sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aEconomic conditions and volatility 4aInequality 4aPro-poor growth 4aEconomic theory & research 4aEmerging markets 4aVolatility 4aFiscal policy 4aProcyclicality 4aFinancial development 4aTerms of trade 4aGrowth1 aBrueckner, Markus1 aCarneiro, Francisco18aPrint Version:iBrueckner, MarkustThe Effects of Volatility, Fiscal Policy Cyclicality and Financial Development on Growth: Evidence for the Eastern Caribbean.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750702758cam a22003974a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000021001642450097001852600047002823000030003295201379003596500037017386500037017756500040018126500022018526500035018746500024019096500030019336500022019637000021019857000019020067000019020257000022020447000017020667000017020837760132021008300036022328300026022688560066022947508The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7508  a(The World Bank)75081 aAmbel, Alemayehu10aMaternal and Child Health Inequalities in Ethiopiah[electronic resource]cAmbel, Alemayehu.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (43 p.)3 aRecent surveys show considerable progress in maternal and child health in Ethiopia. The improvement has been in health outcomes and health services coverage. The study examines how different groups have fared in this progress. It tracked 11 health outcome indicators and health interventions related to Millennium Development Goals 1, 4, and 5. These are stunting, underweight, wasting, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, under-five mortality, measles vaccination, full immunization, modern contraceptive use by currently married women, antenatal care visits, and skilled birth attendance. The study explores trends in inequalities by household wealth status, mothers' education, and place of residence. It is based on four Demographic and Health Surveys implemented in 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2014. Trends in rate differences and rate ratios are analyzed. The study also investigates the dynamics of inequalities, using concentration curves for different years. In addition, a decomposition analysis is conducted to identify the role of proximate determinants. The study finds substantial improvements in health outcomes and health services. Although there still exists a considerable gap between the rich and the poor, the study finds some reductions in inequalities of health services. However, some of the improvements in selected health outcomes appear to be pro-rich. 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aEarly child and childrens health 4aHealth systems development & reform 4aAdolescent health 4aHealth monitoring & evaluation 4aPopulation policies 4aMaternal and child health 4aHealth inequality1 aAmbel, Alemayehu1 aAndrews, Colin1 aBakilana, Anne1 aFoster, Elizabeth1 aKhan, Qaiser1 aWang, Huihui18aPrint Version:iAmbel, AlemayehutMaternal and Child Health Inequalities in Ethiopia.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-750806198cam a22018494a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000015001642450130001792600047003093000030003565201006003866500033013926500016014256500039014416500037014806500019015176500024015366500039015606500031015996500015016306500021016456500020016666500017016866500015017036500020017186500022017386500011017606500021017716500013017926500022018056500019018276500024018466500016018706500012018866500019018986500020019176500016019376500025019536500023019786500012020016500021020136500015020346500022020496500023020716500015020946500028021096500019021376500031021566500012021876500023021996500020022226500024022426500023022666500016022896500017023056500028023226500017023506500020023676500022023876500017024096500013024266500022024396500023024616500022024846500014025066500027025206500025025476500014025726500013025866500025025996500020026246500019026446500017026636500023026806500019027036500010027226500013027326500014027456500019027596500020027786500011027986500012028096500024028216500016028456500020028616500019028816500012029006500010029126500017029226500020029396500014029596500021029736500034029946500010030286500016030386500020030546500030030746500011031046500017031156500018031326500027031506500025031776500016032026500012032186500019032306500013032496500017032626500020032796500024032996500022033236500011033456500013033566500027033696500025033966500020034216500010034416500025034516500008034766500009034846500023034936500016035166500025035326500015035576500027035726500025035996500021036246500029036456500016036746500027036906500016037176500035037336500025037686500023037936500023038166500021038396500012038606500015038726500017038876500022039046500020039266500021039466500020039676500023039876500017040107000015040277000014040427760164040568300036042208300026042568560066042827509The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7509  a(The World Bank)75091 aLuo, Xubei10aHub-Periphery Development Pattern and Inclusive Growthh[electronic resource]bCase Study of Guangdong Province.cLuo, Xubei.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (25 p.)3 aThe hub-periphery development pattern of the Guangdong economy, to some extent, is a miniature of that of the Chinese economy. The Pearl River Delta, drawing from its first-nature comparative advantages in factor endowments and proximity to Hong Kong SAR, China, and Macau SAR, China, and the second-nature advantages as first-movers in the reforms in attracting and retaining domestic and foreign resources, has developed into a regional economic center. This paper examines the pattern of inter- and intra-provincial migration and that of the concentration of production, to explore the challenges and opportunities for the success of "double transfer." The paper suggests a four-prong approach, to improve the business environment, support the realization of latent comparative advantages, increase the skill level of the labor force to support the upgrade of the production structure, and protect the vulnerable, to support the inclusive growth of the economy in Guangdong in a sustainable manner. 4aSocial protections and labor 4aEnvironment

resource (39 p.)3 aIn April 2014, the Government of Benin launched the entreprenant status, a simplified and free legal regime offered to small informal businesses to enter the formal economy. This paper presents the short-term results of a randomized impact evaluation testing three different versions of the entreprenant status on business registration decisions, each version including incremental incentives to registration: (i) information on the new legal status and its benefits, (ii) business training, counseling services, and support to open a bank account, (iii) tax mediation services. The study included 3,600 informal businesses operating with a fixed location in Cotonou, Benin, which were randomly allocated between three treatment groups and one control group. One year after the program launch, all versions of the program had significant impact on formalization rates. The impact was 9.1 percentage points in the first treatment group; 13 percentage points in the second group; and 15.8 percentage points in the last group. The program had a higher impact on male business owners, with more education, operating outside Dantokpa Market, in sectors other than trade, and that before being offered the incentives to formalization had characteristics similar to businesses that were already formal. Data from a second follow-up survey, which is expected to take place in March 2016, will explore the impacts on other outcomes, like business performances or access to banking. 4aPrivate sector development 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aCompetitiveness and competition policy 4aBusiness environment 4aBusiness in development 4aDebt markets 4aE-business 4aBusiness facilitation 4aDeposit 4aLiability 4aQuality of services 4aAccounting 4aEnterprise development 4aTax exemption 4aLegal environment 4aCertificate 4aSales 4aMedium enterprises 4aOption 4aExchange 4aBanking system 4aInformation 4aBank account 4aDeveloping countries 4aSelling 4aMonitoring 4aAccess to bank 4aFinancial statements 4aImpacts 4aLoan 4aTrade sector 4aTax 4aOwnership 4aQuality 4aDummy variable 4aBeneficiaries 4aInternational bank 4aOpen access 4aEnabling environment 4aInformation services 4aBudget 4aEconomic activity 4aSmall business 4aInternational finance 4aInformation banks 4aLink 4aAdvertising 4aData 4aTechnical assistance 4aBusiness regulation 4aCommerce 4aPhone number 4aOne-stop shop 4aCommercial bank 4aImpact evaluation 4aTax regime 4aLicense 4aTrading 4aProductivity 4aBusiness services 4aDirect costs 4aInternational development 4aFinancial products 4aWeb 4aBusiness entry 4aArtisans 4aBusiness registration 4aCash transfers 4aAccount 4aBank financing 4aFinance 4aTax forms 4aPhone 4aHuman capital 4aGood 4aTax rate 4aInspection 4aBusiness management 4aContact information 4aBusiness plan 4aTransparency 4aTurnover 4aFuture 4aMobile phone 4aCompetitiveness 4aElectricity 4aReturns 4aContract 4aFirm performance 4aCost 4aMarket 4aNew markets 4aCommercial law 4aLevy 4aAdministration 4aResult 4aBookkeeping 4aBank loan 4aRegistration system 4aBusiness activity 4aNetwork 4aBusiness 4aID 4aShare 4aTax system 4aCollateral 4aPerformance 4aInstitution 4aProfit 4aProtocol 4aAdministrative process 4aCheck 4aDebit card 4aCommunication 4aChamber of commerce 4aUnfair competition 4aCustomers 4aDatabase 4aImplementing agencies 4aLimited liability 4aBusiness performance 4aImplementation 4aUses 4aRegistration process 4aBusiness training 4aTax obligations 4aMicroenterprises1 aBenhassine, Najy1 aMcKenzie, David1 aPouliquen, Victor1 aSantini, Massimiliano18aPrint Version:iBenhassine, NajytFinding a Path to Formalization in Benin: Early Results after the Introduction of the Entreprenant Legal StatusdWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751003211cam a22004454a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000017001642450130001812600047003113000030003585201620003886500045020086500030020536500039020836500037021226500024021596500057021836500022022406500029022626500015022916500015023066500021023216500019023426500023023616500020023846500008024047000017024127000022024297000021024517760165024728300036026378300026026738560066026997511The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7511  a(The World Bank)75111 aKhan, Qaiser10aBlending Top-Down Federalism with Bottom-Up Engagement to Reduce Inequality in Ethiopiah[electronic resource]cKhan, Qaiser.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (41 p.)3 aDonors increasingly fund interventions to counteract inequality in developing countries, where they fear it can foment instability and undermine nation-building efforts. To succeed, aid relies on the principle of upward accountability to donors. But federalism shifts the accountability of subnational officials downward to regional and local voters. What happens when aid agencies fund anti-inequality programs in federal countries? Does federalism undermine aid? Does aid undermine federalism? Or can the political and fiscal relations that define a federal system resolve the contradiction internally? This study explores this paradox via the Promotion of Basic Services program in Ethiopia, the largest donor-financed investment program in the world. Using an original panel database comprising the universe of Ethiopian woredas (districts), the study finds that horizontal (geographic) inequality decreased substantially. Donor-financed block grants to woredas increased the availability of primary education and health care services in the bottom 20 percent of woredas. Weaker evidence from household surveys suggests that vertical inequality across wealth groups (within woredas) also declined, implying that individuals from the poorest households benefit disproportionately from increasing access to and utilization of such services. The evidence suggests that by combining strong upward accountability over public investment with extensive citizen engagement on local issues, Ethiopia's federal system resolves the instrumental dissonance posed by aid-funded programs to combat inequality in a federation. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aPublic sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aPopulation policies 4aPublic sector corruption and anticorruption measures 4aAccess to finance 4aBanks and banking reform 4aInequality 4aFederalism 4aLocal government 4aAccountability 4aCitizen engagement 4aPublic services 4aAid1 aKhan, Qaiser1 aFaguet, Jean-Paul1 aAmbel, Alemayehu18aPrint Version:iKhan, QaisertBlending Top-Down Federalism with Bottom-Up Engagement to Reduce Inequality in Ethiopia.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751104831cam a22012254a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000022001642450122001862600047003083000030003555201346003856500037017316500030017686500015017986500028018136500024018416500057018656500029019226500013019516500025019646500014019896500011020036500013020146500015020276500013020426500021020556500011020766500018020876500026021056500013021316500034021446500009021786500027021876500015022146500025022296500024022546500012022786500022022906500016023126500025023286500031023536500017023846500016024016500013024176500026024306500015024566500023024716500011024946500015025056500023025206500014025436500019025576500011025766500013025876500014026006500017026146500015026316500015026466500019026616500015026806500008026956500027027036500014027306500021027446500014027656500020027796500014027996500021028136500015028346500015028496500008028646500014028726500015028866500020029016500020029216500018029416500016029596500029029756500014030046500013030186500015030316500024030466500020030706500019030906500013031096500028031226500012031506500017031626500022031796500023032016500030032246500021032546500023032757000022032987760157033208300036034778300026035138560066035397512The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7512  a(The World Bank)75121 aMyerson, Roger B.14aThe Strength of American Federal Democracyh[electronic resource]bLessons for Global Development.cMyerson, Roger B.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (13 p.)3 aA review of the history of the United States from its colonial origins shows how Americas successful development has always been guided by two basic principles: representative democracy, and a proper division of power between national and subnational governments. The United States of America was established as an independent nation by a congress of delegates from 13 provincial assemblies, each of which consisted of representatives elected by their communities. Since colonial times, local democratic rights have attracted immigrants to help build new towns in the growing nation. Responsible local governments in America have had the power and the incentive to make local public investments for developing prosperous communities. Democratic competition in America has been strengthened by the ability of successful local leaders to become competitive candidates for higher offices. But in spite of Americas example, many nations since the French Revolution have instead been drawn to centralized democracy, as national elites may prefer to centralize power around themselves. Americas successful growth ultimately depended on its citizens basic understanding that their welfare and security were enhanced by a balanced federal division of power between their elected local governments and the higher sovereign government of their nation. 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aPublic sector development 4aGovernance 4aPolitics and government 4aPopulation policies 4aPublic sector corruption and anticorruption measures 4aParliamentary government 4aProgress 4aPolitical traditions 4aImmigrant 4aRights 4aGovernor 4aOld regime 4aPolitics 4aState government 4aBribes 4aRight to vote 4aPolitical settlements 4aAutonomy 4aPolicy research working paper 4aBank 4aUniversal human rights 4aGovernment 4aGovernment officials 4aNational government 4aSlavery 4aLocal governments 4aPoliticians 4aPolitical opposition 4aPolitical decentralization 4aBy elections 4aSovereignty 4aMinister 4aLocal representatives 4aMajorities 4aPolicy discussions 4aNation 4aParliament 4aFederal government 4aOligarchy 4aNational level 4aPolicy 4aCitizens 4aDiplomats 4aHuman rights 4aCommittees 4aResolution 4aEqual partners 4aComplaints 4aWar 4aDemocratic development 4aAutocracy 4aLegal protection 4aPatronage 4aPolitical power 4aDemocracy 4aNational leaders 4aPopulation 4aCandidates 4aLaw 4aFranchise 4aLeadership 4aPopular support 4aPolicy research 4aOrganizations 4aLegislators 4aRepresentative democracy 4aOfficials 4aStrategy 4aConfidence 4aPolitical influence 4aRepresentatives 4aPublic service 4aElection 4aElected representatives 4aService 4aLegal rights 4aPolitical support 4aGlobal development 4aRepresentative government 4aPolitical system 4aDevelopment policy1 aMyerson, Roger B.18aPrint Version:iMyerson, Roger B.tThe Strength of American Federal Democracy: Lessons for Global Development.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751202372cam a22003974a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000015001642450114001792600047002933000030003405201000003706500045013706500024014156500031014396500039014706500012015096500025015216500021015466500017015676500015015846500023015996500022016226500019016446500020016637000015016837760148016988300036018468300026018828560066019087513The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7513  a(The World Bank)75131 aReva, Anna10aToward a More Business Friendly Tax Regimeh[electronic resource]bKey Challenges in South Asia.cReva, Anna.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (32 p.)3 aThis paper discusses competitiveness-related issues surrounding the design and administration of corporate and value added/sales taxes in four South Asian countries - Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The paper is based largely on analysis of tax legislation; in addition, data from the World Banks enterprise surveys, the Doing Business report, as well as industry studies are used for evidence on tax compliance costs for business. The review of tax regulations in the region shows several commonalities: (1) widespread use of tax incentives to support selected industries, types of firms, and industrial locations; (2) many exemptions from value-added taxes as well as the practice of levying multiple indirect taxes on the same base; and (3) high costs of tax compliance for businesses. The paper discusses the consequences of tax policies for the competitiveness of South Asian producers, describes the main problems in tax administration, and outlines key directions for reforms. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aLaw and development 4aPrivate sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aTax law 4aTaxation & subsidies 4aEmerging markets 4aDebt markets 4aTax policy 4aTax administration 4aBusiness taxation 4aTax incentives 4aCompetitiveness1 aReva, Anna18aPrint Version:iReva, AnnatToward a More Business Friendly Tax Regime: Key Challenges in South Asia.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751302859cam a22004094a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000031001642450151001952600047003463000030003935201257004236500037016806500022017176500033017396500035017726500034018076500028018416500040018696500029019096500045019386500018019836500024020017000031020257000031020567000026020877000023021137760185021368300036023218300026023578560066023837514The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7514  a(The World Bank)75141 aPerez, Jorge Eduardo Perez10aUnpacking the MPIh[electronic resource]bA Decomposition Approach of Changes in Multidimensional Poverty Headcounts.cPerez, Jorge Eduardo Perez.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (39 p.)3 aMultidimensional measures of poverty have become standard as complementary indicators of poverty in many countries. Multidimensional poverty calculations typically comprise three indices: the multidimensional headcount, the average deprivation share among the poor, and the adjusted headcount ratio. While several decomposition methodologies are available for the last index, less attention has been paid to decomposing the multidimensional headcount, despite the attention it receives from policy makers. This paper proposes an application of existing methodologies that decompose welfare aggregates-based on counterfactual simulations-to break up the changes of the multidimensional poverty headcount into the variation attributed to each of its dimensions. This paper examines the potential issues of using counterfactual simulations in this framework, proposes approaches to assess these issues in real applications, and suggests a methodology based on rank preservation within strata, which performs positively in simulations. The methodology is applied in the context of the recent reduction of multidimensional poverty in Colombia, finding that the dimensions associated with education and health are the main drivers behind the poverty decline. 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aPoverty reduction 4aServices & transfers to poor 4aHealth monitoring & evaluation 4aPoverty monitoring & analysis 4aRural poverty reduction 4aHealth systems development & reform 4aMultidimensional poverty 4aDecomposition and non parametric methods 4aShapley value 4aPoverty transitions1 aPerez, Jorge Eduardo Perez1 aCastelan, Carlos Rodriguez1 aTrujillo, Jose Daniel1 aValderrama, Daniel18aPrint Version:iPerez, Jorge Eduardo PereztUnpacking the MPI: A Decomposition Approach of Changes in Multidimensional Poverty Headcounts.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751402365cam a22003734a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000031001642450100001952600047002953000030003425201030003726500045014026500039014476500036014866500022015226500017015446500029015616500031015906500028016216500012016496500014016616500022016757000031016977760135017288300036018638300026018998560066019257515The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7515  a(The World Bank)75151 aRodriguez-Castelan, Carlos14aThe Poverty Effects of Market Concentrationh[electronic resource]cRodriguez-Castelan, Carlos.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (32 p.)3 aThis paper contributes to the limited literature on the welfare impacts of market concentration by developing a simple model that shows how exogenous variations in market power affect poverty. Increased market power leads to economy-wide welfare losses, because it raises the prices of goods and services for all agents in an economy and thus reduces the relative incomes of households, particularly among the poor. Declines in poverty in this context are only possible in the case wherein the poor have access to a share of oligopolistic rents. Although this scenario seems highly unlikely, this result has important implications for public policy, particularly for economies with less-than-perfect markets and social objectives of poverty eradication. This result suggest the possibility of taxing extranormal rents extracted by firms with market power and redistributing them through targeted lump-sum social transfers, thereby contributing to poverty reduction by mitigating welfare losses from the negative price effect. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aInternational economics & trade 4aAccess to markets 4aDebt markets 4aClimate change economics 4aEconomic theory & research 4aMarkets & market access 4aPoverty 4aOligopoly 4aEndogenous income1 aRodriguez-Castelan, Carlos18aPrint Version:iRodriguez-Castelan, CarlostThe Poverty Effects of Market Concentration.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751502232cam a22003854a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000019001642450149001832600047003323000030003795200785004096500045011946500037012396500022012766500033012986500024013316500018013556500034013736500017014076500019014246500013014436500030014567000019014867000031015057760182015368300036017188300026017548560066017807516The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7516  a(The World Bank)75161 aPfutze, Tobias10aCan a Small Social Pension Promote Labor Force Participation?h[electronic resource]bEvidence from the Colombia Mayor Program.cPfutze, Tobias.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (44 p.)3 aOne of the primary motivations behind the establishment of noncontributory pension programs is to allow beneficiaries to retire from the labor force. Yet, as with other unconditional cash transfer schemes, their aggregate effects may be more complex. Using panel data and instrumental variable techniques, this paper shows that the effect of one such program, Colombia Mayor, has been to raise the labor force participation of relatively younger male beneficiaries. This increase occurred precisely in the occupations with characteristics that are likely to require some up-front investment. The paper concludes that the transfer effectively loosened the liquidity constraints to remaining in these occupations. However, no such effect is found among women or older beneficiaries. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aPoverty reduction 4aSocial protections and labor 4aPopulation policies 4aLabor markets 4aPoverty monitoring & analysis 4aDebt markets 4aLabor policies 4aPensions 4aLabor force participation1 aPfutze, Tobias1 aRodriguez-Castelan, Carlos18aPrint Version:iPfutze, TobiastCan a Small Social Pension Promote Labor Force Participation?

This paper seeks to go beyond the emergency phase and explore the challenges surrounding protracted refugee situations. The paper examines the refugee situation in Sub-Saharan Africa from a long-term angle, from the perspective of refugees own agency as well as from the perspective of the host community. The paper aims to shed light on the economic lives of refugees in their host communities. Starting with an overview of the situation of refugees in Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper draws on findings from the literature to debunk some entrenched beliefs about refugees. The discussion of refugee crises in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda draws some lessons. The decision to return is discussed and it is argued that the decision depends on the socioeconomic condition in the host country versus the country of refuge, integration versus return policies in place, the individual set of skills of each refugee, and his or her subjective perception of the political climate in both countries. 4aEducation 4aConflict and development 4aUrban development 4aHealth, nutrition and population 4aPost conflict reconstruction 4aPopulation policies 4aEducation for all 4aHealth monitoring & evaluation 4aStreet children 4aRefugees 4aEconomic development 4aPublic policy1 aVerwimp, Philip1 aMaystadt, Jean-Francois18aPrint Version:iVerwimp, PhiliptForced Displacement and Refugees in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Economic Inquiry.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751702467cam a22003734a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000021001642450119001852600047003043000030003515201181003816500014015626500022015766500023015986500022016216500033016436500024016766500012017006500009017126500029017217000021017507000022017717000018017937760154018118300036019658300026020018560066020277518The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7518  a(The World Bank)75181 aDe Hoyos, Rafael10aUnderstanding the Trends in Learning Outcomes in Argentina, 2000 to 2012h[electronic resource]cDe Hoyos, Rafael.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (41 p.)3 aThis paper seeks to understand what drove the trends in learning outcomes in Argentina between 2000 and 2012, using data from four rounds of the Program for International Student Assessment. A year-specific education production function is estimated and its results used to decompose the changes in learning outcomes into changes in inputs, parameters, and residuals via microsimulations. Estimates of the production function show the importance of socioeconomic status, gender, school autonomy, and teacher qualifications to determine learning outcomes. Despite an important increase in the level of resources invested in public education, learning outcomes in public schools decreased vis-a-vis private schools. According to the results presented here, the increase in the number of teachers in the system, pushing the pupil-teacher ratio in Argentina to 11, had no effect on learning outcomes. The microsimulation further confirms that changes in the system's ability to transform inputs into outcomes accounted for most of the changes in test scores. Overall, the study shows the ineffectiveness of input-based education policies to improve learning outcomes in Argentina. 4aEducation 4aEducation for all 4aTertiary education 4aPrimary education 4aEffective schools & teachers 4aSecondary education 4aQuality 4aPisa 4aDeterminants to learning1 aDe Hoyos, Rafael1 aHolland, Peter A.1 aTroiano, Sara18aPrint Version:iDe Hoyos, RafaeltUnderstanding the Trends in Learning Outcomes in Argentina, 2000 to 2012.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751803190cam a22004214a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000018001642450120001822600047003023000030003495201749003796500033021286500039021616500022022006500019022226500018022416500031022596500015022906500026023056500024023316500022023556500015023776500015023926500010024077000018024177000022024357000029024577760154024868300036026408300026026768560066027027519The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7519  a(The World Bank)75191 aCancho, Cesar10aWhy So Gloomy?h[electronic resource]bPerceptions of Economic Mobility in Europe and Central Asia.cCancho, Cesar.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (46 p.)3 aDespite significant improvements in per capita expenditures and a marked decline in poverty over the 2000s, a large fraction of Eastern Europe and Central Asias population reports their economic situation in the late 2000s to be worse than in 1989. This paper uses data from the Life in Transition Survey to document the gap between objective and subjective economic mobility and investigate what may drive this apparent disconnection. The paper aims at identifying some of the drivers behind subjective perceptions of economic mobility, focusing on the role of perceptions of fairness and trust in shaping peoples perceptions of their upward or downward mobility. The results show that close to half of the households in the region perceive to have experienced downward economic mobility, that is, that their position in the income distribution has deteriorated. The results also show that perceptions of higher inequality, unfairness, and distrust in public institutions are associated with downward subjective economic mobility. The findings from this study confirm that factors beyond objective well-being are associated with the perceptions of mobility observed in Europe and Central Asia and may explain why the region has had such a pessimistic view of economic mobility during the past two decades. Understanding what drives peoples perceptions of their living standards and quality of life is important, because regardless of objective measures, perceptions could influence peoples behavior, including support for reforms and labor market decisions. For Eastern Europe and Central Asia, a region that has undergone substantive transformations and which is still going through a reform process, accounting for these aspects is critical. 4aSocial protections and labor 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aPoverty reduction 4aLabor policies 4aLabor markets 4aEconomic theory & research 4aInequality 4aSubjective well-being 4aRelative well-being 4aEconomic mobility 4aInequality 4aUnfairness 4aTrust1 aCancho, Cesar1 aDavalos, Maria E.1 aSanchez-Paramo, Carolina18aPrint Version:iCancho, CesartWhy So Gloomy?: Perceptions of Economic Mobility in Europe and Central Asia.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-751902405cam a22004094a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000023001642450123001872600047003103000030003575200993003876500013013806500039013936500022014326500029014546500029014836500028015126500028015406500010015686500009015786500016015876500012016036500021016157000023016367000023016597000028016827760157017108300036018678300026019038560066019297520The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7520  a(The World Bank)75201 aKaminski, Jonathan10aSeasonality in Local Food Markets and Consumptionh[electronic resource]bEvidence from Tanzania.cKaminski, Jonathan.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (37 p.)3 aThis paper revisits the extent of seasonality in African livelihoods. It uses 19 years of monthly food prices from 20 markets and three years of nationally representative household panel surveys from Tanzania. Trigonometric specifications are introduced to measure the seasonal gap. When samples are short and seasonality is poorly defined, they produce less upward bias than the common dummy variable approach. On average, the seasonal gap for maize prices is estimated to be 27 percent; it is 15 percent for rice. In both cases it is two and a half to three times higher than in the international reference market. Food price seasonality is not a major contributor to food price volatility, but it does translate into seasonal variation in caloric intake of about 10 percent among poor urban households and rural net food sellers. Rural net food-buying households appear able to smooth their consumption. The disappearance of seasonality from Africas development debate seems premature. 4aIndustry 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aPoverty reduction 4aFood & beverage industry 4aClimate change economics 4aRural poverty reduction 4aMarkets & market access 4aMaize 4aRice 4aSeasonality 4aCalorie 4aFood consumption1 aKaminski, Jonathan1 aChristiaensen, Luc1 aGilbert, Christopher L.18aPrint Version:iKaminski, JonathantSeasonality in Local Food Markets and Consumption: Evidence from Tanzania.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-752002688cam a22003974a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000023001642450103001872600047002903000030003375201295003676500014016626500039016766500022017156500033017376500019017706500023017896500020018126500033018326500031018656500026018966500028019226500023019507000023019737000027019967760139020238300036021628300026021988560066022247521The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7521  a(The World Bank)75211 aMcKenzie, David J.10aDevelopment Economics as Taught in Developing Countriesh[electronic resource]cMcKenzie, David J.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (46 p.)3 aThis paper uses a combination of survey questions to instructors and data collected from course syllabi and examinations to examine how the subject of development economics is taught at the undergraduate and masters levels in developing countries, and benchmark this against undergraduate classes in the United States. The study finds that there is considerable heterogeneity in what is considered development economics: there is a narrow core of only a small set of topics such as growth theory, poverty and inequality, human capital, and institutions taught in at least half the classes, with substantial variation in other topics covered. In developing countries, development economics is taught largely as a theoretical subject coupled with case studies, with few courses emphasizing data or empirical methods and findings. This approach contrasts with the approach taken in leading U.S. economics departments and with the evolution of development economics research. The analysis finds that country income per capita, the role of the state in the economy, the education level in the country, and the involvement of the instructor in research are associated with how close a course is to the frontier. The results suggest there are important gaps in how development economics is taught. 4aEducation 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aPoverty reduction 4aSocial protections and labor 4aLabor policies 4aTertiary education 4aPro-poor growth 4aEffective schools & teachers 4aEconomic theory & research 4aDevelopment economics 4aUndergraduate education 4aKnowledge transfer1 aMcKenzie, David J.1 aPaffhausen, Anna Luisa18aPrint Version:iMcKenzie, David J.tDevelopment Economics as Taught in Developing Countries.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-752102472cam a22003974a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000024001642450118001882600047003063000030003535201004003836500045013876500031014326500039014636500017015026500031015196500052015506500022016026500021016246500022016456500019016676500028016867000024017147000034017387000021017727760153017938300036019468300026019828560066020087522The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7522  a(The World Bank)75221 aDemirguc-Kunt, Asli14aThe Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Firms Capital Structureh[electronic resource]cDemirguc-Kunt, Asli.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (60 p.)3 aUsing a data set covering about 277,000 firms across 79 countries over the period 2004-11, this paper examines the evolution of firms capital structure during the global financial crisis and its aftermath in 2010-11. The study finds that firm leverage and debt maturity declined in advanced economies and developing countries, even in countries that did not experience a crisis. The deleveraging and maturity reduction were particularly significant for privately held firms, including small and medium enterprises. For small and medium-size enterprises, these effects were larger in countries with less efficient legal systems, weaker information-sharing mechanisms, shallower banking systems, and more restrictions on bank entry. In contrast, there is weaker evidence of a significant decline of leverage and debt maturity among firms listed on a stock exchange, which are typically much larger than other firms and likely benefit from the "spare tire" of easier access to capital market financing. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aPrivate sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aDebt markets 4aEconomic theory & research 4aBankruptcy and resolution of financial distress 4aAccess to finance 4aEmerging markets 4aCapital structure 4aCorporate debt 4aGlobal financial crisis1 aDemirguc-Kunt, Asli1 aMartinez-Peria, Maria Soledad1 aTressel, Thierry18aPrint Version:iDemirguc-Kunt, AslitThe Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Firms Capital Structure.dWashington, D.C. : The World Bank, 2015. 0aPolicy research working papers. 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-752202967cam a22003974a 45000010005000000030015000050050017000200060019000370070015000560080041000710240027001120350025001391000019001642450122001832600047003053000030003525201516003826500045018986500039019436500036019826500017020186500031020356500052020666500022021186500018021406500016021586500018021746500024021927000019022167000027022357000023022627760156022858300036024418300026024778560066025037523The World Bank20160111180634.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng  8 a10.1596/1813-9450-7523  a(The World Bank)75231 aBattaile, Bill10aDebt Sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africah[electronic resource]bUnraveling Country-Specific Risks.cBattaile, Bill.  aWashington, D.C. :bThe World Bank,c2015.  a1 online resource (37 p.)3 aSub-Saharan African countries as a group showed a considerable reduction in public and external indebtedness in the early 2000s as a result of debt relief programs, higher economic growth, and improved fiscal management for some countries. More recently, however, vulnerabilities in some countries are on the rise, including a few with very rapid debt accumulation. This paper looks at the heterogeneous experiences across Sub-Saharan African countries and the detailed dynamics that have driven changes in public debt since the global financial crisis. Borrowing to support fiscal deficits since 2009, including through domestic markets and Eurobond issuance, has driven a net increase in public debt for all countries except oil exporters benefitting from buoyant commodity prices and fragile states receiving post-2008 Highly Indebted Poor Country relief. Current account deficits and foreign direct investment inflows drove the external debt dynamics, with balance of payments problems associated with very rapid external debt accumulation in some cases. Pockets of increasing vulnerabilities of debt financing profiles and sensitivity of debt burden indicators to macro-fiscal shocks require close monitoring. Specific risks that policy makers in Sub-Saharan Africa need to pay attention to going forward include the recent fall in commodity prices, especially oil, the slowdown in China and the sluggish recovery in Europe, dependence on non-debt-creating flows, and accounting for contingent liabilities. 4aFinance and financial sector development 4aMacroeconomics and economic growth 4aInternational economics & trade 4aDebt markets 4aEconomic theory & research 4aBankruptcy and resolution of financial distress 4aAccess to finance 4aExternal debt 4aPublic debt 4aExternal debt 4aDebt sustainability1 aBattaile, Bill1 aHernandez, F.

Improving Romania's competitive environment will attract new firms, weed out inefficient ones, and enhance growth potential. An effective competition policy leads to success in the areas of Romania's domestic market efficiency, economic growth and European market integration. Following a comprehensive functional review of the Romanian Competition Council carried out by the World Bank in 2010, weaknesses, needs and priorities were identified. This book presents the results of the World Bank's Advisory Services which were designed to provide solutions in the identified reform areas during 2012-2015. The Advisory Services provided an innovative delivery model that involved integrated expertise to (i) review the legal and regulatory framework for competition; (ii) offer advocacy support to streamline competition policy principles with other governmental policies and strengthen intergovernmental relations, especially with sectoral regulators (electricity and telecommunication) and the prosecutor's office; (iii) state-of-the-art capacity building to strengthen the Council's staff's technical knowledge; and (iv) optimize internal procedures to allow for improvements in institutional functioning using Enterprise Architecture methodology, which provided an in-depth institutional assessment and the development of a target business and information technology architecture. The Competition Council has started to apply some of the upgraded regulatory instruments. These, combined with the analytical skills in antitrust law and economics acquired with the World Bank support, have been already applied in recent antitrust cases, market inquiries meant to identify competition constraints in sectors that have great importance for consumers and infrastructure projects with state aid elements.  aDescription based on print version record. 4aAntitrust 4aCompetition council 4aCompetition policy 4aMarket regulation 4aSector regulation 4aState aid 4aUnfair competition1 aAprahamian, Arabela1 aPop, Georgiana08aPrint Version:z9781464806209 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-1-4648-0620-903234cam a22003614a 4500001000700000003001500007005001700022006001900039007001500058008004100073020002900114020001800143035002700161245006400188260006000252300003100312490003400343520219800377588004702575650001302622650000902635650000902644650001102653650001502664650001602679650001302695650001202708650000802720650001502728776003402743830002602777856006902803210681The World Bank20160112182617.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng    a9781464806827c49.99 USD  z9781464806810  a(The World Bank)21068110aInternational Debt Statistics 2016h[electronic resource]b  aWashington, D.C. :bInternational Monetary Fund,c2015.  a1 online resource (186 p.)1 aInternational Debt Statistics3 aInternational Debt Statistics (IDS) 2016 (formerly Global Development Finance) provides statistical tables showing the external debt of 125 developing countries that report public and publicly guaranteed external debt to the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS).

These indicators are correlated with the region's long-term development and important drivers of economic success. Moreover, research is a key ingredient for quality higher education. The research performance of these regions is compared to that of South Africa, Malaysia, and Vietnam; the latter two countries had a comparable research base to the SSA regions at the beginning of the period of analysis.  aDescription based on print version record. 4aGrowth 4aHigher education 4aResearch 4aScience and technology education 4aSTEM1 aAdil, Mariam1 aBlom, Andreas1 aLan, George08aPrint Version:z9781464807008 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-1-4648-0700-801479cam a22003494a 4500001000700000003001500007005001700022006001900039007001500058008004100073020002900114020001800143035002700161245009700188260006000285300003100345490003300376520031000409588004700719650002600766650002600792650002200818650003000840650005200870650001500922650001900937650002600956650001800982776003401000830002601034856006901060210558The World Bank20160112182617.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||020129s2015    dcu     o    i00  0 eng    a9781464805592c14.99 USD  z9781464805585  a(The World Bank)21055814aThe Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology 2015h[electronic resource]  aWashington, D.C. :bInternational Monetary Fund,c2015.  a1 online resource (244 p.)1 aWorld Development Indicators3 aThis Little Data Book on Information and Communications Technology 2015 presents tables for over 213 economies showing the most recent national data on key indicators of information and communications technology (ICT), including access, quality, affordability, efficiency,sustainability, and applications.  aDescription based on print version record. 4aAccess to information 4aBroadband connections 4aBroadband service 4aCommunications technology 4aInformation and communications technology (ICT) 4aInnovation 4aKey indicators 4aMobile communications 4aNational data08aPrint Version:z9781464805585 0aWorld Bank e-Library.40uhttp://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-1-4648-0558-501374cam a22004098i 450000100090000000300150000900500170002400600190004100700150006000800410007501000150011602000310013102000260016203500290018804000230021704200080024005000220024808200190027024501000028926300110038926400470040030000350044733600210048233700250050333800230052850400510055150500290060258800470063161000330067861000220071165000530073365000330078671000160081977600340083583000260086985600690089518596361The World Bank20151005123303.0m        d        cr cn|||||||||150429m2015    dcu      b   i001 0 eng    a2015005895  a9781464802201 (alk. paper)  z9781464802218 (ebook)  a(The World Bank)18596361  aDLCbengcDLCerda  apcc00aGE170b.W673 201500a363.7/056122304aThe World Bank Group's partnership with the Global Environment Facility.h[electronic resource]  a201505 1aWashington, DC :bThe World Bank,c[2015]-  a1 online resource (volumes cm)  atext2rdacontent  aunmediated2rdamedia  avolume2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.1 avolume 1.
